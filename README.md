# Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture

**Project Description**
 
A farmer reached out to us as a machine learning expert seeking help to **select the best crop for his field**. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures:

Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
Potassium content ratio in the soil
pH value of the soil

The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?

**Project Tasks**

In this project, two techniques are introduced for feature selection and apply them to the farmer's problem. By working on this project, I gained valuable insights into how machine learning can solve real-world agricultural problems.
